    "### Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scratch\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SVM Basic Concepts and Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperplane**: A decision boundary separating different classes. In an n-dimensional space, the hyperplane can be represented as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w \\cdot x + b = 0 $\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( w \\) is the weight vector, \\( x \\) is the input vector, and \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Margin**: The distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point of each class. SVM aims to maximize this margin.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Optimization Problem**: SVM solves the following optimization problem to find the optimal hyperplane:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\min_{w, b} \\frac{1}{2} \\|w\\|^2 $\n",
    "\n",
    "subject to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ y_i (w \\cdot x_i + b) \\geq 1 \\quad \\forall i $\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( y_i \\) is the class label of the \\( i \\)-th data point, and \\( x_i \\) is the \\( i \\)-th data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective Function (Optimized version)\n",
    "The objective function of a linear SVM with L2 regularization is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",

    "- \\( b \\) is the bias term.\n",
    "- \\( C \\) is the regularization parameter.\n",
    "- \\( y_i \\) are the labels {-1, 1}.\n",
    "- \\( x_i \\) are the feature vectors.\n",
